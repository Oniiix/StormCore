# StormCore

StormCore is a dynamic third-person shooter with roguelite elements. 
Play as a forgotten cyborg, reactivated to save a dying alien planet from its creators’ catastrophic mistakes. 
With modular limbs and great firepower, blast through hordes of alien insects, optimize your build, obtain powerful upgrades, and reach the StormCore terraformer tower before the world collapses in just three days.

## KEY FEATURES

Mix and match 4 limb types/abilities (Primary Weapon, Secondary Weapon, Kicks, Movement) to tailor your experience to your own playstyle and build.

For each 3-day cycle, use the first 2 days to build up your strength.
